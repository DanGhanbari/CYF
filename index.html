        <li id="text">The basis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Gordon_Selfridge" target="_blank">Harry Gordon Selfridge's</a> success was his relentlessly innovative marketing, which was elaborately expressed in his Oxford Street store. Originally from America himself, Selfridge attempted to dismantle the idea that consumerism was strictly an American phenomenon. He tried to make shopping a fun adventure and a form of leisure instead of a chore, transforming the department store into a social and cultural landmark that provided women with a public space in which they could be comfortable and legitimately indulge themselves. Emphasizing the importance of creating a welcome environment, he placed merchandise on display so customers could examine it, moved the highly profitable perfume counter front-and-centre on the ground floor, and established policies that made it safe and easy for customers to shop. These techniques have been adopted by modern department stores around the world.

        <li>Either Selfridge or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Field" target="_blank">Marshall Field</a> is popularly held to have coined the phrase "the customer is always right", and Selfridge used it regularly in his advertising             </li>

Selfridge attracted shoppers with educational and scientific exhibits and was himself interested in education and science, believing that the displays would introduce potential new customers to Selfridges and thus generate both immediate and long-term sales.           </li>
